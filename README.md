Express-admin for learning and works. This project can be used for anyone who learn or use nodejs/express.js

## Getting Started

The project's also helpful if you have a large system. For example: You can use it as a front-end (handle user/role) and use to request to others inside back-end server. Nodejs's good for highload web system.

### Database Specification:

Project uses Sequellize ORM for nodejs, config in config file. By example, Sequellize use sqlite database but it's an ORM so it can change easily to MySQL or other sql database.

Database and log files are put outside project folder into a folder name 'db_express'. It will make sure no data lost when updating/replacing Project folder (Ex by 'puppet agent -t')
